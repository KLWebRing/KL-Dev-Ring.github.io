# KL Dev-Ring

**Kerala's Builder Network. Ranked by what you ship. Connected by what you build.**

KL Dev-Ring is an open-source network of developers, founders, researchers,
students, hackers, creators, and maintainers with personal websites. There are
no accounts, feeds, likes, or followers. The Git repository is the database,
pull requests are the signup flow, and GitHub Pages is the infrastructure.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4173`. The project has no runtime or build dependencies.

```bash
npm run validate
npm test
npm run build
```

The production site is emitted to `dist/`.
